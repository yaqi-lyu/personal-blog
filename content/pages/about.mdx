  - body: "# About YakShaver\n\nYakShaver is about practical engineering—shaving scope, not yaks. We share patterns, components, and decision frameworks that help teams ship faster without sacrificing maintainability.\n\n## What you'll find here\n\n- Architecture guides and trade-off analyses\n- Production-ready UI components and utilities\n- Templates and checklists for repeatable delivery\n- Notes from the field: performance, DX, and incident learnings\n\n## Why \"YakShaver\"?\n\nBecause we've all been there: five detours deep, configuring something that shouldn't be this hard. Our goal is fewer detours, sharper tools, and clear guidance.\n\n## Work with us\n\nHave a gnarly problem or just want a second set of eyes? Reach out—we're happy to help you ship and learn.\n"
