    body: "# Willow Lyu\n\n## My Journey\n\nI am a software engineer based in SSW's Hangzhou office. Before joining SSW, I spent four years as a product manager before transitioning to full-stack development. My combined experience gives me a strong foundation in understanding user needs, planning projects, and delivering end-to-end software solutions. I also enjoys working in diverse teams and values collaboration and continuous learning.\n\nI primarily works with .NET, EF Core, and React, focusing on delivering clean, efficient, and user-friendly solutions. I am also exploring emerging technologies, including AI-powered tools, to enhance productivity and improve project outcomes.\n\n## Outside of Work\n\nI enjoy reading, especially detective fiction. One of my favorite novels is 13.67 by Chan Ho-Kei. The story is about a legendary detective uncovering Hong Kong's darkest crime. Interestingly, Chan worked as a software developer before becoming a writer.\_I also enjoy learning Japanese and exploring new experiences.\n"
