Let me tell you about how I built this blog using TinaCMS. Basically I followed this vibe coding guidance: [Vibe Coding with TinaCMS](https://tina.io/docs/vibe-coding)

## Getting Started

First, I set up a TinaCloud-hosted project following the official guide. The process was quite straightforward. I connected my project with Vercel and went through all six steps from the quickstart documentation. Everything worked smoothly, which was a good start.

After getting the starter template running, I did something smart. I asked an AI agent to look through all the files in my project. This helped me understand how everything was organized. Later, when I needed to add new features, the AI already knew about my project structure, which saved me a lot of time.

## Building the Blog

The next step was planning what sections I wanted on my homepage. I used AI to help me think of different content blocks that would work well for a blog. Then I started adding these blocks one by one through TinaCMS.

One thing I really liked was building small components step by step. I would create one feature, test it to make sure it worked properly, and only then move on to the next one. This approach made everything feel less overwhelming and helped me catch problems early.

## What Went Well

The setup process was much easier than I expected. The documentation was clear, and I didn't get stuck anywhere. Using AI to understand my codebase at the beginning was definitely helpful because it became like a knowledgeable assistant who understood my project.

Testing each component before moving forward also worked really well. It meant I always had something working, even if I hadn't finished everything yet.

## What I Would Do Differently

I learned some important lessons too. Sometimes the AI would forget to update the TinaCMS-specific parts of my code. I discovered that if I mention TinaCMS right from the start in my prompts, the AI does a better job of keeping everything connected properly.

Another mistake I made was not planning the design completely before I started coding. Halfway through building the category block, I changed my mind about how it should look. This meant I had to redo some work that was already finished.

## Final Thoughts

Overall, vibe coding with TinaCMS was a positive experience. It made building a blog feel more creative and less technical. The combination of AI assistance and TinaCMS's visual editor meant I could focus on what I wanted my blog to look like rather than getting lost in complicated code.

For anyone thinking about trying this approach, my advice is to plan your design first and always mention TinaCMS when asking AI for help with features. These small things can save you a lot of time and make the whole process smoother. 🤖
