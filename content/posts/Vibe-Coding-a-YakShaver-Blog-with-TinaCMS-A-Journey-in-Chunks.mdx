excerpt: >
  Building a modern blog doesn't have to be overwhelming. In this post, I share
  my journey of "vibe coding" a blog for YakShaver using TinaCMS and
  Vercel—starting with a cloud-hosted foundation, mapping the entire codebase
  with AI to create a reusable context, and then building feature by feature in
  satisfying chunks. No rigid plans, no perfectionism—just continuous forward
  momentum, one block at a time. Learn how combining TinaCMS's flexible content
  blocks, Vercel's instant deploys, and AI-assisted development created a
  workflow that felt less like grinding and more like vibing.
